## Getting started 

* Install Ollama

    * Go to `Ollama official website`

    * Download it for your OS
    
    * Come to your `Window Powershell`

    * Run and install a new LLM with `Ollama run <LLM Name>` (get it from Ollama Models Websites)

    * Exit powershell, confirm that ollama is running in the background (look at system tray, see ollama icon)

* Make a new virtual environment (venv), see this [blog (for Windows)](https://medium.com/@ajaytshaju/how-to-make-a-virtual-environment-in-python-windows-17a30b67d3bc)    
* Initialize the venv using `.\<venv_name>\Scripts\activate` (Windows)

* Install dependencies in venv
        
        pip install ollama streamlit

* Run the streamlit app using the command `streamlit run app.py`

    * Try it on other devices `on your network` using the `Network URL`
